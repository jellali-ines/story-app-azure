export const ORIGINAL_STORY = `The Little Birds in the Magical Forest
In a faraway forest full of giant trees and colorful flowers, lived little birds who loved to play and sing. Among them was a small bird named Toto.
Toto loved flying fast, but he didn't always listen to his friends' advice. The big bird said to him: "Toto, take your time and watch the path before you fly so fast!"
But Toto didn't listen and flew very quickly between the trees, until he bumped into a large branch and fell to the ground.
His friends came to help him, and a small duck said: "Look, Toto, speed alone is not enough. You need to be careful too!"
Toto learned an important lesson: to be careful and listen to others' advice. From that day, he flew carefully and enjoyed playing and singing with his friends in the magical forest.
Moral: Speed alone is not enough; caution and listening to advice make life better and safer.`;
